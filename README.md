firstly create a map in your mind how to do your project
To begin Open vs code app
and create a new file.
Using npm in the vs code terminal
type npm init -y
Then type npm install express
Then type npm install nodemon
Then type npm install dotenv
Then type npm install pg
type npx create-react-app habit-track-react
then a bunch of our files will be created.
Now start the npm server by
typing npm start
Then open the browser and type localhost:3000 or it will automatically open your web browser
Then type npm install react-router-dom
Then type npm install react-icons
Then type npm install bootstrap
Then type npm install axios
Then type npm install react-bootstrap
Then type npm install react-router-bootstrap
and then delete unnecessary files from it
you can also see it in coding ninja video tutorials about the files that we can delete
and then now
clear app.js file
for to make simple habit track we need 2 files
1.javascript file
2.css file
let's start with the javascript file
first import necessary react components and start writing code,functions ,logics etc.... which are necessary for code.
And you can style as your Liking.
and lastly link every file to one main file.
so now you can browse your app with ease and with beauty design you created.

It is a simple Habit Track App Project.Thank You
